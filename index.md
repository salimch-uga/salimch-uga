I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Verimag](https://www.verimag.fr), [Universit√© Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). 

### From April 2021, I am working on :

####[CPS4EU] (https://cps4eu.eu/) 
European project which aims to deal with technical problems as well as organizational problems of CPS (Cyber Physical Systems).

### I worked on :

####[BRAIN-IoT] (https://www.brain-iot.eu/) 
European project that aims at establishing a framework and methodology that supports smart autonomous and cooperative behaviors of populations of heterogeneous IoT platforms that are also closely interacting with Cyber-Physical systems (CPS). (From April 2019 to March 2021)

####[MODMED] (http://vasco.imag.fr/MODMED/MODMEDHome.html) 
ANR project that focus on analysis of execution traces of cyber-physical systems. (From March 2018 to April 2019)

I defended my [Ph.D.] (https://theses.univ-oran1.dz/document/15201707t.pdf) in computer science on 2017 at University of Oran 1 (Algeria) in collaboration with University of Grenoble Alpes (France).
