## May 2019 - until now: 
Post-doctoral researcher, VERIMAG Laboratory, UGA, France.

Projects : EU [CPS4EU] (https://cps4eu.eu/), EU BRAIN-IoT] (https://www.brain-iot.eu/)  

Mission: formal modeling and verification of IoT systems, risk assessment in IoT. 

Actions: 
-Proposal of approach and tools for security risks assessment in IoT systems and for exploring countermeasures with a high impact on attacks targeting IoT systems. 
-Application of SMC (Statistical Model Checking) for analyzing sensors behavior, and for formal modeling and verification of collaborative intelligent robots system.
